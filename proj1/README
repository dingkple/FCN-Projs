In this project, the main process is create a socket, send the hello message, if the server
responsed, check if the data recieved meet the specific form, if yes, generate a solution message
and send it to the server, then repeate the check-generate solution-send-recive process until
encountered the BYE message, and then check the new message and output the recieved 
64-byte-secret-flag.


The biggest chanllenge for me in this project is to find the way to connect using ssl, I tried some
ways specifying the certification files, but none of them works, at last I tried setting
cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_NONE and it worked.

For mainly functions, I used all the possible commands to test my code:
-p port -s hostname nuid
-p port hostname nuid
-s hostname nuid
hostname nuid

and also created some cases to check iff the data recieved meet the given form.
