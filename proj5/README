HTTPSEVER:

1. Here we use python's BaseHTTPServer and SocketServer to implement our server,
for every requests, we follow the steps below:
    1. get the hash of (hostname, path), then check if it's in the cache, 
        if yes, read the file form disk
        else, fetch the file from the original server, then compare the url with 
        the original url, if they'r the same and status is 200, cache the page, else
        return the status and page content
    2. after getting the content of the webpage, we check if the status is 200,
    if yes, return the client

DNSSERVER:
1. For packet class, it's mainly responsible for constructing and unpacking dns
    packets
2. For DNS server, we also used SocketServer to implement it, for every request, we
    now only return the origin IP addr now, the follwing days we will work on 
    selecting the best server.
