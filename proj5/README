HTTPSEVER:

1. Here we use python's BaseHTTPServer and SocketServer to implement our server,
    for every request, we first get the request's hash, and check if it exists in
    our cache, if yes, read file and return it, else, download the file from the
    remote origin server and cache it.


DNSSERVER:
1. For packet class, it's mainly responsible for constructing and unpacking dns
    packets
2. For DNS server, we also used SocketServer to implement it, for every request, we
    now only return the origin IP addr now, the follwing days we will work on 
    selecting the best server.
